Bot keyboard

### Attributes:

| Name     |    Type       | Required | Description |
|----------|---------------|----------|-------------|
|resize|[Bool](/API_docs/types/Bool.html) | Optional|Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically for optimal fit (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if there are just two rows of buttons). If not set, the custom keyboard is always of the same height as the app's standard keyboard.|
|single\_use|[Bool](/API_docs/types/Bool.html) | Optional|Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it's been used. The keyboard will still be available, but clients will automatically display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat â€“ the user can press a special button in the input field to see the custom keyboard again.|

Other users in the group don't see the keyboard.|
