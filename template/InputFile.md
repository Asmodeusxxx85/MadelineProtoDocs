The following syntax can also be used:

```php
$%s = 'filename.mp4'; // The file path can also be used
$%1$s = 'https://google.com'; // A URL can also be used
```

You can also use async streams, HTTP response objects, and [much more](https://docs.madelineproto.xyz/docs/FILES.html#downloading-files)!
